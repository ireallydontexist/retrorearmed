<a id="about">About</a><br/>
RetroRearmed is by NotArizona and is an unofficial branch of the open-source project RetroArch.<br/>
RetroArch is a simple Multi-emulator frontend based on libretro by Themaister.<br/>
Libretro is an API designed for simple abstraction of the functions inherent in retro-style, 2D games.<br/>
While the most common use case for libretro has been console emulation, it is equally suited as a platform for almost any 2D game.<br/>

<a id="help">Pro Tips</a><br/>
- RetroRearmed does not currently change the overlay based on device rotation.<br/>
A default overlay has been chosen but you may want to choose a better fit in the in-game "core" settings.<br/>
- RetroRearmed looks for files places in /var/mobile/Documents/ and allows for browsing directories inside it.<br/>
- Emulation cores such as the psx emu core PCSX ReArmed by <a href="https://github.com/notaz">Notaz</a> requires you to place the following BIOS files at /var/mobile/Documents/.RetroRearmed/ and requires the BIOS filenames to be all lowercase: scph1001.bin scph5500.bin scph5501.bin scph5502.bin scph7502.bin<br/>
- BIOS and ROM files used by RetroRearmed should have file permissions set at least to "read" by the "mobile" user.<br/>
- Config files and directories used by RetroRearmed should have file permissions set at least to "read" and "write" by the "mobile" user.<br/>
